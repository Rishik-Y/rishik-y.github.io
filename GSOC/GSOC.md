# Google Summer Of Code 2025 With Waycrate

I'm glad to able to participate in [Google's Summer of Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Summer_of_Code) 2025 program with [Waycrate](https://waycrate.github.io/index.html). I have been looking into GSoC for a few months and I'm happy that after a rabbit hole of looking at different projects that I was able to find a project I was interested in.

# What's your project about?
To put it in a nutshell: It's basically about implementing a new standardised wayland protocol to a Rust library called [libwayshot](https://github.com/waycrate/wayshot).
