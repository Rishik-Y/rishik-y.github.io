## **17th May: Writing Some Code**

Hi! Quick note â€” I was travelling on the **16th of May**, so I didnâ€™t get anything done that day.
But today (the 17th), I decided to take a step back and get my fundamentals straight.

### **Why I Did This (Even If It's Not Directly Wayshot-Related)**

While trying to dive into Wayshot and the new Wayland protocols (`ext-image-capture-source` and `ext-image-copy-capture`), I realized something:

> A lot of this was going over my head.

Iâ€™ve worked with Wayland protocols before (specifically in [wluma](https://github.com/maximbaz/wluma)), but that was over a year ago. And honestly, Iâ€™ve forgotten more than I remembered :P

So instead of blindly poking at new protocol code, I decided to go back to basics and **build a simple Wayland client in Rust** â€” just to refresh how globals are registered, how outputs are discovered, and how events are handled.

### **What the Client Does**

This tool is kind of a Rust-powered, simplified version of `wayland-info`.
It connects to a Wayland server and:

* Retrieves the **global registry** of all available interfaces
* Binds to all `wl_output` interfaces
* Logs useful details about each output:

  * Geometry
  * Resolution + refresh rate
  * Scale factor
  * Name & description

Nothing fancy. No screenshots. Just info.

### **What I Got Out of It**

Even though itâ€™s not part of Wayshot directly, this little detour helped me:

* Relearn how `wl_registry` and `wl_output` work
* Understand how `Dispatch` works in the Rust `wayland-client` crate
* See how roundtrips and event queues are used to sync state
* Feel a little less lost in the Wayland world :)

Honestly, doing this helped me recollect a lot of forgotten context â€” especially useful for when I start writing new protocol bindings later.

Thatâ€™s all for today!<br>
It might seem like a tangent, but sometimes taking a step back is the fastest way to move forward. âœ¨
