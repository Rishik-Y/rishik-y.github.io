#####  Now Let's Talk About Wayshot

So far, weâ€™ve covered the *why* â€” the fragmentation of screen capture protocols on Wayland, and how the new `ext-image-capture-source-v1` and `ext-image-copy-capture-v1` aim to solve that.

Now itâ€™s time to talk about the *how* â€” and the tool Iâ€™m working with: **[Wayshot](https://github.com/waycrate/wayshot)**.

##### What is Wayshot? ðŸ“¸

Wayshot is a native, blazing-fast ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ screenshot tool for wlroots based compositors such as sway and river written in Rust.<br>
It uses the `wlr-screencopy` protocol under the hood to capture screenshots.

It is *`grim` alternative â€” but written in Rust.*

It's lightweight and CLI-friendly, perfect for quick screenshots on wlroots.

##### What am I adding to Wayshot?

Currently, Wayshot only supports the wlroots-specific `wlr-screencopy` protocol. That works great â€” if you're on a wlroots compositor.
But the moment you want to support KDE, GNOME, or any future-compliant compositor that uses the new official Wayland protocols, you're out of luck.

So here's the Idea:

> **Add support for the new `ext-image-capture-source-v1` and `ext-image-copy-capture-v1` protocols to Wayshot.**

In simpler terms:
- Allow Wayshot to list available capture sources (monitors/windows).
- Allow capturing from those sources using the *official* protocol.
- Keep the old `wlr-screencopy` backend as a fallback for older compositors.

##### Why This is needed?

- It makes Wayshot **future-proof**.
- It improves **compatibility** across all major compositors (not just wlroots).
- It sets the stage for integrating with **portals** and **security-friendly workflows**.
