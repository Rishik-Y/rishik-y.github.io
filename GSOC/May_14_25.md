## 14th May: "So... What have I been doing?"

Okay, now that all the explanations and introductions are out of the way...

#### What have I actually done so far? And what exactly am I planning to do moving ahead?

First of all — 9th May was the day I officially found out I got selected for GSoC! 🎉 <br>
Wait... the official announcement was on the 8th? Yeah, technically. But for me it came in at 00:05 IST on the 9th, so I’m counting it as the 9th :P

That said, I didn’t get much done those first few days — I was travelling from 9th to 11th, so it was more about letting it all sink in than doing any actual work.

#### 12th May: Experimentation and Dev Diary Chaos

This was when I really started thinking about writing the dev log — how to approach it, what tone to use, what structure, etc.

At first, I tried to mimic Sooraj’s (a previous GSoC mentee) dev log. It seemed like a solid reference — clean, structured, worked well for him.

However Halfway through, Just like when I was working on my proposal, I went 

"Nah. Imma do my own thing."

I scrapped everything and started over from scratch.<br>
Yeah, it came out looking kinda ugly. But it felt more “me.” Honest, straightforward, and a little chaotic. :D

Funny enough — this exact thing happened during the proposal writing phase.<br>
Aakash, My mentor (Now turns out to be Org mentor) suggested I use Sooraj’s proposal as a reference.

I did.<br>
And then... I didn't.<br>
Once again: "Imma do my own thing."<br>

I suppose, making my proposal good enough.

#### Dev Log Plan Moving Forward

Right now, I’m thinking of turning this dev diary into a mini website — nothing fancy, but with:

- Forward/backward links
- A homepage
- Proper structure and navigation

I'll probably check with Rachancheet (my mentor) on whether that’s a good idea or if I’m doing something totally wrong.

#### Other Things I Did:

One thing the GSoC Mentors and Aakash kept insisting on was:

"Get the payment stuff sorted early."

to not get stuck in future.

So I went ahead and got that done as well. ✅<br>
No surprises, no delays (hopefully).

#### A Note to Myself:

I don’t know how long or short these dev logs are supposed to be...<br>
But one thing’s for sure:

    This isn’t going to be my final submission log.

This is more like a live journal — raw thoughts, progress, and chaos. The polished version can come later.

Well thats all for today. ✌️
