Google Summer of Code 2025 with Waycrate!

This website is basically a Documentation of the project I worked on,
Why and what Changes I did,
What new features I added,
What bugs I encountered,
What I learned,
What I new features can be added for the people next!

I will be explaining in a manner such that even newbie in Linux could understand,
So for people who are proffessionals in Linux, please go easy on me, for simplifying some parts of the documentation.

So what is the project on about?
In a very layman terms, it is making a screenshot tool making it cross compatible across all wayland based compositors.

Now for those who didn't a single thing go through this first,
as I believe you can understand atleast the basics of Linux,

<details>
<summary>What is Linux?</summary>
What is Linux?
Think of Linux as Basically an Operating System,

Now What is an Operating System?
Windows or Mac which you use is basically an Operating System,
Think of Linux as Basically an Operating System,

Now Unlike in Windows and Mac which are fixed in Display nature,
Linux doesn't have any restrictions.
So Linux currently has 2 types of Displaying model:
1. X11
2. Wayland

Whats the difference between X11 and Wayland?
X11 is the older one and Wayland is the newer one.

- X11 works perfectly fine on Linux and has all the components working perfectly fine.
- Wayland is the newer one and is more efficient and is great working with latest monitors.

X11 is slowly becoming obsolete and being replaced by Wayland.

I would still highly recommend for people who do use linux but haven't explored the depth of linux to go through this documentation.
