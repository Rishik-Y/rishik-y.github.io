Google Summer of Code 2025 with Waycrate!

This website is basically a Documentation of the project I worked on,
Why and what Changes I did,
What new features I added,
What bugs I encountered,
What I learned,
What I new features can be added for the people next!

I will be explaining in a manner such that even newbie in Linux could understand,
So for people who are professionals in Linux, please go easy on me, for simplifying some parts of the documentation.

So what is the project on about? \
In a very layman terms, it is making a existing screenshot tool making it cross compatible across all wayland based compositors.

Wayshot is a screen capture client for Wayland compositors (which in this instance act as servers) that 
implement the wlr-screencopy protocol (which at this point is mostly compositors based on the wlroots library like sway , river, etc).

Now for those who didn't understand a single thing go through this first,\
[What is Linux?](What_is_linux.md)

[What is Wayland Compositor?](What_is_wayland_compositor.md)

I would highly recommend for people who do use linux but haven't explored the depth of linux to go through this documentation as well.
