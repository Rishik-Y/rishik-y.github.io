Google Summer of Code 2025 with Waycrate!

This website is basically a Documentation of the project I worked on,
Why and what Changes I did,
What new features I added,
What bugs I encountered,
What I learned,
What I new features can be added for the people next!

I will be explaining in a manner such that even newbie in Linux could understand,
So for people who are proffessionals in Linux, please go easy on me, for simplifying some parts of the documentation.

So what is the project on about? \
In a very layman terms, it is making a screenshot tool making it cross compatible across all wayland based compositors.

Now for those who didn't understand a single thing go through this first,\
[What is Linux?](What_is_linux.md)

I would highly recommend for people who do use linux but haven't explored the depth of linux to go through this documentation as well.
