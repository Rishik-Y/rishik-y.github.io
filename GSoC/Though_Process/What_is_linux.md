What is Linux?
Think of Linux as Basically an Operating System for now,

Windows or Mac which you may use is basically an Operating System,
Think Linux as the same but with a lot more customizability,

Now Unlike in Windows and Mac which uses their own Displaying model,
Linux doesn't have any restrictions.
So Linux currently has 2 types of Displaying model:
1. X11
2. Wayland

What is X11?
Technically, it's a network-transparent windowing system and protocol that provides the basic framework for a graphical user interface (GUI) on Linux and other Unix-like systems. 
More colloquially, think of it as the long-standing, foundational graphics stack for the Linux desktop that has been the standard for decades. 
If you have ever used Linux before, you've used X11, as it was the default on nearly every major Linux distro for a very long time.

What is Wayland?
It's a set of protocols that determine how programs that want to draw things on the screen communicate with each other on Linux (and BSD-based) systems. 
More colloquially, think of it as an ecosystem of building blocks for the Linux desktop. Chances are good you're already using Wayland if you're on a recent Linux distro.

Whats the difference between X11 and Wayland?
X11 is the older one and Wayland is the newer one.

- X11 works perfectly fine on Linux and has all the components working perfectly fine.
- Wayland is the newer one and is more efficient and is great working with latest monitors.

X11 is slowly becoming obsolete and being replaced by Wayland.

Now what I just said About ~~Linux being an Operating System~~?
Scratch that, As Linux is actually a kernal!

Now what is a kernal?
It's basically the core of the Operating System.
When in a conversation, we metaphorically say that Linux is an Operating System, which comprises of all the distro's (Ubuntu, Fedora, Opensuse) present out there which rely on Linux kernal.

So from now on out! 
I will be refering Linux as a kernal.
