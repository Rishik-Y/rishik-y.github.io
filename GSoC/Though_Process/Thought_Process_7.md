## **Adding Polish and Minor Features**

After getting the major feature of area capture working on `sway-git`, I shifted my focus to smaller refinements and adding some useful, minor features to the new backend.

---

### More Detailed Output Info

First, I added a simple function to get more detailed information on a specific output, which is helpful for debugging and for users who want to know more about their display setup.

---

### Pixel Color Picker (`ext_capture_color`)

Next, I integrated a handy feature to get the RGB color value of a single pixel. This function, `ext_capture_color`, was taken directly from **Decode's codebase**.

It's a clever implementation that reuses the `ext_area_capture` function I already built, simply by telling it to capture a tiny 1x1 pixel area corresponding to the pixel under the cursor.

---

### Better Scale Handling

I also refactored how the output scale factor is handled. Previously, this was being calculated manually. I updated the `OutputInfo` struct to get the scale value directly from the `wl_output` dispatch event instead. This is a much cleaner and more reliable approach.

---

### Smarter Frame Handling

To improve capture reliability, I added a `Pending` state to the `FrameState`. Before this change, a capture might fail immediately if the frame wasn't ready. Now, the process will wait for the frame to finish being processed, preventing unnecessary errors.

### Direct PNG Conversion

I was still finding the `DynamicImage` conversion logic within `libwayshot` a bit complicated to work with. So, for my new `ext` method, I implemented a more direct PNG converter. This new logic lives in the main `wayshot` binary's code rather than in the `libwayshot` library, which simplified the implementation for now.
