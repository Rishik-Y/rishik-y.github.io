## **Conclusion and Final Accomplishments**

With the main logic solidified, I finally started working again on the **streaming usecase** in Wayshot.

However, since this experimental work is not included in my final Pull Request for the project, I believe it's not right for me to explain it in detail here as part of my official GSoC work.
