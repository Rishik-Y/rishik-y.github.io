## **Conclusion and Final Accomplishments**

With the main logic solidified, I finally started working again on the **streaming usecase** in Wayshot.

However, since this experimental work is not included in my final Pull Request for the project, I believe it's not right for me to explain it in detail here as part of my official GSoC work.

### Final Project Goals: Accomplished

Alas, this brings my development journey to a close. I'm happy to report that all of the original proposal goals were successfully accomplished:

- **Introducing `Ext_*` protocols to Wayshot:** Check ✔️
- **Implementing Top-level window capture:** Check ✔️
- **Turning the `wlr` backend into a legacy codebase:** Check ✔️
- **Adding notifications for Output/App-ID:** Check ✔️
- **Adding additional features along the way:** Check ✔️
