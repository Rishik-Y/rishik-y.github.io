## **Unifying the Save and Fallback Logic**

With all the major capture features implemented and working, I turned my attention to the final integration steps. The main goals were to completely merge the saving mechanisms of the `wlr` and `ext` methods and to make the fallback logic more robust.

### Unifying the Image Saving Process

Up until now, the two backends handled saving images very differently:

- **WLR Method:** Had a comprehensive saving system that could convert images to various formats like `webp`, `png`, and `jpg`.
- **EXT Method:** Had a very basic saver that could only output `png` files. My focus had been on the capture logic, so the saving part was kept simple for the time being.

To unify this, I refactored the `ext` method's functions to work with `DynamicImage`, the same versatile image object used by the `wlr` method. Once that was done, I was able to remove my old, simple PNG saver entirely. Now, the `ext` backend uses the existing, powerful saving functions from the `wlr` backend, and both methods share the exact same code for saving files to any supported format.

### A More Robust Fallback

I also took another look at the fallback mechanism between the two capture protocols. Instead of having two completely separate functions that created two distinct pathways, I modified the code to use a **single, unified function**. This function is now smart enough to swap internally between the `ext` and `wlr` capture methods as needed, which makes the code much cleaner and easier to maintain.

-----

### More Descriptive Notifications

Finally, I made a small but useful change to the notifications. They are now more descriptive about the *type* of capture that was taken. For example, if a user isn't capturing a full output or a specific app, the notification will now explicitly say something like **"Type: Pixel Color grab"** or **"Type: Area Cropping"**. This is much clearer and more informative for the user.
