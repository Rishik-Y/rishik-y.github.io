Google Summer of Code 2025 with Waycrate!

This website documents the project I worked on during GSoC 2025 under Wayshot (a high-performance screenshot utility for Wayland compositors).

Project Idea: Add support for the new ext-image-capture-source-v1 and ext-image-copy-capture-v1 protocols to Wayshot.

For a thorough explanation of my thought process from start to finish: [My Thought Process](Though_Process/Thought_Process_1.md)

For direct info on the end changes I made: [My End Changes](End_Changes.md)

Helpful links: [Research Links](Resources.md)

I will be explaining in a manner such that even a newbie in Linux could understand. For professionals, please go easy on me for simplifying some parts of the documentation.
